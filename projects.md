    <strong>Reflection Of Data Compression 2.2 :</strong>
    <p>
     Moderate compression is best because it makes the file smaller but still clear. Lossy compression is good for videos or images when small quality loss is not a problem. It is not efficient for important files like documents or medical images. This shows abstraction because we can use compression tools without knowing exactly how they work.
