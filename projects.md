    <h2>Part D â€“ Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      In my experiment, moderate compression gave the best balance between size and quality, reducing the file significantly while keeping it clear. 
      Lossy compression is acceptable when small quality loss does not affect the purpose, such as for videos, images, or audio shared online. 
      It is not acceptable when exact data is needed, like documents, code, or medical images. 
      This experiment shows abstraction in computer science because we can use compression tools without needing to understand all the underlying algorithms, focusing instead on input, output, and effects.
