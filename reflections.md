    <strong>Reflection Of Ice Cream Overflow Code Project :</strong>
    <p>
    Overflow happens if I enter more than 5 scoops. The cone becomes empty again because it cannot fit more data. The cone demonstrates abstraction because it hides the code and represents memory graphically. I learned that binary and compression both deal with constrained space and efficiency. You need to pack data into compact storage without losing its meaning.

<h2>Big Idea1 Notes</h2>

  <section>
      Collaboration helps people make better solutions. When people work together, they can share ideas and help each other. It is easier to find problems and fix them. Teamwork makes solutions stronger, faster, and more creative. Working with others also helps everyone learn and improve their skills.

When creating a program, it is important to understand the task or situation first. Data can be stored in variables to make it easier to use. Each part of the code has a function, and together they make the program work. This helps solve problems step by step.

When designing a program, it is important to choose the best method to reach the goal. Working with others helps improve ideas and solve problems faster. Each part of the code has a clear function. It is also important to respect the work and ideas of other people.

When creating a program, it is important to plan the best method to reach the goal. Errors can happen in the code or algorithm. Testing helps find these mistakes. By checking and fixing errors carefully, the program works correctly and solves the problem as planned.

<h2>Big Idea2 Notes</h2>
 
  <section>
    <strong>Reflection Of Binary Number 2.1 :</strong>
    <p>
    Binary numbers use only 0 and 1. They represent on and off. Each digit is called a bit. Computers use binary because they understand on and off signals. With just these two numbers, they can store data and perform calculations. Binary is needed for a computer to function correctly.

    <strong>Reflection Of Data Compression 2.2 :</strong>
    <p>
     Moderate compression is best because it makes the file smaller but still clear. Lossy compression is good for videos or images when small quality loss is not a problem. It is not efficient for important files like documents or medical images. This shows abstraction because we can use compression tools without knowing exactly how they work.

    <strong>Reflection of Extracting Information from Data 2.3 :</strong>
    <p>
    Metadata shows detailed information about data and it helps us to organize data easier. Cleaning data is so important because in order to get a successful result you need a clean code. Bias can happen for example if you choose middle school students instead of the whole school. By processing data we can see patterns and make smarter decisions.

    <strong>Reflection of Extracting Information from Data 2.4 :</strong>
    <p>
      People use steps to work with data. They make rules to study the data and find patterns. This allows them to learn more about the information. When they know more, they can make good choices and solve problems. Learning how to do this is important in today’s world.

    <h2>Reflection - List :</h2>
    <p>
1.I chose this theme because writing letters is easy and I can write them on both computers.
</p>
     2. I learned that lists let me store many items in one place and access them easily by their index.
     </section>
     3. The loop will stay the same but I will need to add more items to my list.

  <h2>Swift Design Challenge V1 Reflection</h2>
<section>
Nadin’s story inspired me because she showed passion and creativity and even if she did not have experience she did a great job. In the future, I want to create projects that can be useful to other people. And do this in a way that people can both have fun and learn from my projects.
