    <strong>Reflection Of Ice Cream Overflow Code Project :</strong>
    <p>
    Overflow happens if I enter more than 5 scoops. The cone becomes empty again because it cannot fit more data. The cone demonstrates abstraction because it hides the code and represents memory graphically. I learned that binary and compression both deal with constrained space and efficiency. You need to pack data into compact storage without losing its meaning.
